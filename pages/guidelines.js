              To help your Business Profile approval go as smoothly as possible,
              review the common missteps below that can slow down the review
              process or trigger a rejection. This doesn’t replace the
              guidelines or guarantee approval, but making sure you can check
              every item on the list is a good start.
            </p>
            <p> Make sure you: </p>

            <ul className='list-disc pl-4'>
              <li>
                Ensure you are registering a business and not a registered
                company
              </li>
              <li>Are using your own business name</li>
              <li>Are 16 years or older</li>
              <li>
                Check if your business name is not already registered with
                Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className='text-2xl'>
              1. <strong>Business Logo</strong>
            </h3>

            <p>
              Your business logo is what users will remember when they think of
              your Business Profile. Logos should not include content that is
              offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in
              exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy. Examples of such
              content include:
            </p>
            <p>
              1.1 Be sure to not use images when promote defamatory,
              discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or
              commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender,
              national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if
              the image is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted
              individual or group.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.2 Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed,
              maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence.
              Images cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real
              government, corporation, or any other real entity.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.3 Images that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and
              dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or
              ammunition.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s
              Dictionary as &quot;explicit descriptions or displays of sexual
              organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than
              aesthetic or emotional feelings&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.5 Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading
              quotations of religious texts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Business Logos which fall within these examples are subject to
              your Business Profile being rejected and further prohibited from
              featuring in our Phonebook.
            </p>
            <h3 className='text-2xl'>
              2. <strong>Business Name</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              A business’s name contributes to their brand. Business names
              should not include words which are offensive, insensitive,
              upsetting, intended to disgust, explicit or just plain creepy.
              Business names should not encourage racism, violence, crudity,
              recklessness, illegal activities or religious beliefs.
            </p>
            <h3 className='text-2xl'>
              3. <strong>Social Media Handles</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              We encourage businesses to add social media handles to their
              Business Profiles. Ensure social media handles:
            </p>

            <p>
              3.1 Do link directly to the business’s presence on the social
              media platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2 Are active, therefore not broken, if while reviewing your
              business profile we recognise the link doesn’t show a user, we
              will remove the link from your business profile. A good way to
              ensure the @username is not broken is to type the username after
              the website in a web browser URL. For example: To test
              @quickappsbb on Facebook we type ‘www.facebook.com/quickappsbb’ in
              our web browser URL.
            </p>
            <p>3.3 Do not promote:</p>
            <p>3.3.1 Illegal activities </p>
            <p>3.3.2 Explicit content </p>
            <p>3.3.3 Violence</p>
            <p>3.3.4 Racism</p>
            <p>3.3.5 Crudity</p>
            <p>3.3.6 Offensiveness</p>

            <h4 className='text-2xl'>
              4 <strong>Other Business Data Accuracy</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Customers should know what type of business they contacting when
              they visit your Business Profile so make sure all other business
              data is accurate, including your bio, subcategory and website.
              Remember to keep them up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.1 Ensure your bio describes your business&apos;s
              services/products to your customers clearly. Refrain from putting
              hours of operation, websites, email address, contact information,
              social media handles and addresses in your bio, as their are
              provisions for those types of data on your Business Profile. You
              are allowed to use emojis in your bio.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.2 Select the most accurate subcategory for your Business
              Profile. If you don&apos;t see a subcategory which is applicable
              for your Business Profile, you may contact us. If you&apos;re way
              off with your selection, your Business Profile may be rejected and
              you will have to resubmit a new Business Profile or we may change
              the subcategory for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.3 Your website should lead to your business&apos;s website.
              Websites should not lead to broken links. Ensure your website does
              not promote:
            </p>

            <p>4.3.1 Illegal activities </p>
            <p>4.3.2 Explicit content </p>
            <p>4.3.3 Violence</p>
            <p>4.3.4 Racism</p>
            <p>4.3.5 Crudity</p>
            <p>4.3.6 Offensiveness</p>
            <p>4.3.6 Pornagraphic Content</p>
            <h4 className='text-2xl'>
              <strong>After You Submit</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Once you’ve submitted your Business Profile in the QuickBusiness
              app and you’re in the review process, here are some things to keep
              in mind:
            </p>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-4'>
              <li>
                <strong>Timing:</strong> We will examine your Business Profile
                as soon as we can.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Status Updates:</strong> The current status of your
                Business Profile will be reflected in QuickBusiness app, so you
                can keep an eye on things from there.
              </li>
              <li>Are 16 years or older</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rejections:</strong> Our goal is to apply these
                guidelines fairly and consistently, but nobody’s perfect. If
                your Business Profile has been rejected and you have questions
                or would like to provide additional information, please contact
                us at quickbusinessapps@gmail.com. This may help get your
                Business Profile in QuickBusiness Book, and it can help us
                improve the Business Profile Review process or identify a need
                for clarity in our policies.
              </li>
